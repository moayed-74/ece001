In the first half of the twentieth century, science fiction introduced the world to the concept of artificial intelligent robots.  It started with the "heartless" tin man from the Wizard of Oz and continued with the robot who posed Maria in Metropolis.  By the 1950s, we had a generation of scientists, mathematicians, and philosophers who had the concept of artificial intelligence (or artificial intelligence) culturally absorbed in their minds.  One of them was Alan Turing, a young British polymathist who explored the mathematical potential of artificial intelligence.  Turing suggested that humans use available information as well as the mind to solve problems and make decisions, so why can't machines do the same?  This was the logical framework for his 1950 paper titled "Computing and Intelligence" in which he discussed how to build smart machines and how to test their intelligence.



  In the early fifties of the last century, the cost of renting a computer amounted to $ 200,000 per month.  Only prestigious universities and major technology companies can afford the costs in this unknown water.  There was a need to demonstrate the concept as well as advocacy by prominent people to persuade funding sources that deserve automated intelligence to follow.
 1956. At this landmark conference, envisioning a major collaborative effort, he brought together leading researchers from various fields for an open discussion on artificial intelligence, a term he coined in the event itself.  Unfortunately, the conference did not live up to McCarthy's expectations.  People came and went as they liked, and there was a failure to agree on standard methods for this area.  However, everyone is totally in agreement with the feeling that AI is achievable.  The importance of this event cannot be underestimated as it spurred the next 20 years of artificial intelligence research.
  From 1957 to 1974, Amnesty International flourished.  Computers can store more information and become faster, cheaper and more accessible.  Machine learning algorithms have improved and people have improved knowledge of the algorithm that should be applied to their problem
  In the 1980s, two sources reverted to artificial intelligence: expanding the algorithm's toolkit, and increasing money.  John Hopfield and David Rommelhardt popularized "deep learning" techniques that allowed computers to learn using the experience.  On the other hand, Edward Vignbaum introduced expert systems that simulate a human decision making process.  The program will ask an expert on how to respond in a specific situation, and once you know this in almost every situation, non-experts can get advice from this program.  Expert systems have been widely used in industries.  The Japanese government has largely funded expert systems and other endeavors related to artificial intelligence as part of a fifth-generation computer project.  From 1982 to 1990, they invested $ 400 million with the goal of revolutionizing computer processing, implementing logical programming, and improving artificial intelligence.  Unfortunately, most of the ambitious goals have not been achieved.  However, it can be said that the indirect effects of FGCP have inspired a talented young generation of engineers and scientists.  Regardless, FGCP funding stopped, and artificial intelligence fell out of the spotlight.
  Ironically, in the absence of government funding and public noise, Amnesty International has flourished.  During the 1990s and 2000, many historical goals of artificial intelligence were achieved.  In 1997, world chess champion and major pioneer Gary Kasparov was defeated by IBM's Deep Blue, a computer chess program.  This high-media game was the first time that the world chess champion had lost a computer, and was a major step towards an artificially intelligent decision-making program.  In the same year, speech recognition software, developed by Dragon Systems, was implemented on Windows.  This was another major step forward but towards the endeavor to interpret the spoken language.  There seems to be no problem that the machines cannot handle.  Even human emotions were a fair game as evidenced by Kismet, a robot developed by Cynthia Breazeal that can recognize and display emotions.
  We were not smarter about how coding artificial intelligence, what has changed?  It turns out that the basic storage limit of a computer that has been holding us back for 30 years is no longer a problem.  It is estimated that the memory and speed of computers double every year, it has finally received, and in many cases, exceeded our needs.  This is exactly how Deep Blue defeated Gary Kasparov in 1997
