        <td>Increase work efficiency
  AI machines are great for performing a specific repeat job with amazing efficiency.  The simple reason is that they remove human errors from their tasks to achieve accurate results every time they perform this specific task.
  Moreover, these machines can work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, unlike humans.  Consequently, it eliminates the need to deploy two groups of staff working in night and day shifts to work on important assignments.  For example, AI assisted chat assistants can answer customer inquiries, provide support to visitors every minute of the day, and boost company sales.</td>
        <td>Although technical experts cast a blessing for humanity, many scientists and ordinary citizens alike fear artificial intelligence.  This fear has reached the silver screen several times in the form of films depicting the miserable futures contracts created by the artificial intelligence machines that seized the planet.  The most prominent of this matrix and matrix.
  Artificial intelligence is unsustainable
  Intelligent machines have distinctive high computing capabilities with a range of processors.  These computer chips contain rare earth materials such as selenium as a major component.  Besides, the batteries of these machines run on lithium, which is also a rare element in the Earth's crust.  The increased mining of these materials is irreversibly hurting our environment.  Moreover, they consume huge amounts of energy to work, which puts a lot of pressure on our power plants and is damaging the environment again.</td>

        <td> Work with high accuracy
  Scientists work to teach machines that work with artificial intelligence to solve complex equations and perform critical tasks themselves so that the results obtained are more accurate compared to their human counterparts.
  Their high accuracy made these machines indispensable to work in the medical field in particular, due to the seriousness of the tasks.  Robots improve the diagnosis of serious conditions in the human body and perform accurate surgeries to reduce the risk of human lives.</td>
        <td>Fewer jobs
  There is no doubt that machines perform routine and repetitive tasks much better than humans.  Many companies prefer machines rather than humans to increase their profitability, thereby reducing the jobs available to the workforce.</td>

<td>    Reducing the cost of training and operation
  Artificial intelligence uses machine learning algorithms like deep learning and neural networks to learn new things like humans.  This way they eliminate the need to write new code every time we need them to learn new things.
  There are many research and development processes taking place in the world to develop artificial intelligence devices that improve their machine learning capabilities so that they learn faster about new processes.  In this way, the cost of training robots is much lower than that of humans.  Moreover, the machines actually reduce the cost of operations with their high efficiency and accurate work performance.  For example, machines do not take breaks and can perform the same mundane task over and over again without any interruption or change in results.  </td>
<td>   Threat to Humanit
  Elon Musk is one of the smartest people working on artificial intelligence today.  He has also publicly stated that artificial intelligence is the greatest threat to human civilization in the future.  This means that the miserable future that science fiction films show is not impossible.  Also, Stephen Hawking has always shown his difference with advances in artificial intelligence.
  The biggest danger associated with artificial intelligence is that machines will acquire sensitivities and turn on humans if they are exposed to fraud.   </td>

<td>   Process improvement
  The best part about AI machines being deployed for work is that they allow us to collect massive amounts of data related to their work.  This data can be processed to gather insights into the processes through quantitative analysis so that we can further improve them.
  The machine learning capabilities of AI machines are increasing more and more even for the analysis themselves. </td>
