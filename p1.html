What is artificial intelligence?
 From SIRI to self-driving cars, AI is advancing rapidly.  While science fiction often portrays artificial intelligence as robots with human-like properties, artificial intelligence can include anything from Google search algorithms to Watson from IBM to independent weapons.
Artificial intelligence today is correctly known as narrow artificial intelligence (or weak artificial intelligence), because it is designed to perform a narrow task (for example only face recognition, internet searches only, or driving only).  However, the long-term goal of many researchers is to create general artificial intelligence (AGI or strong artificial intelligence).  While narrow AI may outmaneuver humans on any mission of their own, such as playing chess or solving equations, AGI will outperform humans in almost every epistemic task.In the short term, the goal of keeping the impact of artificial intelligence on society beneficial stimulates research in many areas, from economics and law to technical topics such as verification, validity, security, and control.  While it may be more than just a slight inconvenience if your laptop crashes or gets compromised, it becomes more important for the AI to do what you want it to do if it controls your car, plane, pacemaker, or your automated trading system.  Or your electricity grid.  Another short-term challenge is to prevent a devastating arms race in deadly independent weapons.
In the long run, the important question is what will happen if the search for strong artificial intelligence and the artificial intelligence system become better than humans in all cognitive tasks.  As IJ Good pointed out in 1965, designing smarter AIs is in itself a cognitive task.  Such a system can undergo frequent self-improvement, which leads to an intelligence explosion leaving the human mind far away.  By inventing new revolutionary technologies, this superior intelligence may help us eliminate war, disease, and poverty, and thus the creation of strong artificial intelligence may be the largest event in human history.  However, some experts have expressed concern that it may be the last as well, unless we learn to align AI goals with our goals before they become super intelligent. There are some who question whether strong AI will ever be achieved, and others insist that creating the AI is going to be beneficial.  At FLI we recognize both of these possibilities, but we also realize that the AI system can cause intentionally or unintentionally significant harm.  We believe research today will help us better prepare for and prevent these potential negative consequences in the future, thereby enjoying the benefits of artificial intelligence while avoiding pitfalls. The frightening and futuristic images of artificial intelligence that dominate movies and novels, and shaping popular fiction, are fictional.  Indeed, artificial intelligence is really changing our daily lives, almost completely in ways that improve human health, safety and productivity.  Unlike movies, there is no race for robots in sight or even possible
